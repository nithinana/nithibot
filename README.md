ight so if your reading this here is all u probs wanna know how to set up this simple response bot in node.js

COMMAND NAME is the command thats going to be replied to by the bot (you can replace it with anything)
COMMAND RESPONSE is the the response to COMMAND NAME (you can change to anything you like as well)

LOGGING INTO YOUR BOT:
if you are using https://repl.it to host your discord bot create an enviroment variables (which can be found on the tab on the left side of your screen)
when you are on enviroment variables create a secret called TOKEN and instert your bot token there
HOWEVER if you are hosting the discord bot manually/locally through your own pc replace process.env.TOKEN with your bot token possibly with quotation marks

okay now you gotta save it monitor
next time you run the bot on repl.it you will have your bot running 24/7

btw you can add more commands if you want
